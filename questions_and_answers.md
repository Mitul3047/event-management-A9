  <h1>MCQ TEST</h1>
</div>

###### 1. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
let greeting;
greetign = {};
console.log(greetign);
```

- A: `{}`
- B: `ReferenceError: greetign is not defined`
- C: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

<i>In this code, there is a typo in the variable name. It is declared as greeting, but it's accessed as greetign. Due to this typo, a ReferenceError is thrown, indicating that greetign is not defined.</i>

###### 2. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

sum(1, "2");
```

- A: `NaN`
- B: `TypeError`
- C: `"12"`
- D: `3`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

<i>JavaScript is dynamically typed, and the + operator is used for both addition and string concatenation. In this case, when you call sum(1, "2"), JavaScript converts the number 1 to a string and then concatenates it with the string "2", resulting in the string "12". Therefore, the function returns "12", and it's then converted to a number when it's logged, giving you the value 3.</i>

###### 3. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
const food = ["🍕", "🍫", "🥑", "🍔"];
const info = { favoriteFood: food[0] };

info.favoriteFood = "🍝";

console.log(food);
```

- A: `['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- B: `['🍝', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- C: `['🍝', '🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

<i>The info object's favoriteFood property initially references the first element of the food array, which is "🍕". Later, it's changed to "🍝", but this change doesn't affect the food array. Therefore, when you log food, it remains unchanged, and the output is ['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔'].</i>

###### 4. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
function sayHi(name) {
  return `Hi there, ${name}`;
}

console.log(sayHi());
```

- A: `Hi there,`
- B: `Hi there, undefined`
- C: `Hi there, null`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

<i>The sayHi function expects a name argument, but when you call it with sayHi(), you don't provide any argument. In this case, name is undefined, so the template string includes undefined, resulting in "Hi there, undefined."</i>

###### 5. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
let count = 0;
const nums = [0, 1, 2, 3];

nums.forEach((num) => {
  if (num) count += 1;
});

console.log(count);
```

- A: 1
- B: 2
- C: 3
- D: 4

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

<i>The forEach loop iterates over the nums array and increments the count variable for each non-falsy value. In JavaScript, 0 is considered falsy, so it doesn't increment count. Only the values 1, 2, and 3 are non-falsy, and they increment count by 1 each time. Therefore, the final value of count is 1, and that's what is logged.</i>
